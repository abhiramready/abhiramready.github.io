# 👋 Hi, I'm Abhiram

I'm Abhiram, a seasoned 🚀Web Developer with a passion for working with Reactive Code⚛️ and all things Frontend💻

Here's how I strive to create value as a developer:

* React: Deliver minimal and bug-free code, utilizing all of React's features to their fullest potential.
* CSS: Confidently code required UI and designs, with the ability to enhance it further.
* Non-Functional Requirements: Prioritize critical aspects such as Accessibility, SEO, and Performance to ensure the best possible user experience.
* Learning: Currently, I'm exploring Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript

Thank you for taking the time to read my introduction. Have a pleasant day ahead! ✨
